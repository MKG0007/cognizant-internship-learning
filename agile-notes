- Incremental(You build the project piece by piece.)
- Iterative(You build a "rough version" of the whole thing, then make it better with each pass.)


Agile:
- it is methodology that delivers software or value incrementally from the start of the project instead of all at once at the end.
- it breaks down large projects into smaller , manageable chunks called iterations or sprints.
- MVP(minimum viable product)


Agile Manifesto:(drafted in 2001 by 17 software developers in US)
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.(there is no contract and customer can reuqest for the new feature anytime)
- Responding to change over following a plan.


Team roles:
1)product Owner(represents the end customer and also manages the product backlog)
where "product backlog" is the master list of tasks

2)scrum master(they are a servant-leader. Their job is to make sure the team follows Scrum rules and to remove "blockers" (e.g., if a developer is waiting for a database password, the Scrum Master gets it))

3)delivery teams(who decelops the product arroding to the given requirement)



meetings of Agile process:
1)the sprint(2 weeks)
- the time period where work happens
- delivery team and scrum master

2)sprint planning(in which meet deciedes what to do in next upcoming week(on which user stories))
- delivery team and scrum master

3)daily scrum(15 min meeting in which developers report about his yesterdays work , today what they do and any issue they are facing to the scrum master)
- delivery team and scrum master


4)sprint review(meeting where the team presents what they have deliverd over a sprint to product owner)
- delivery team , product owner and scrun master


5)sprint retrospective(The team meets privately to ask, "What went well? What went wrong? How can we be faster next time?")

agile myths:
- agile anti-documentation
- agile is anti- planning
and many more 

but truth is that agile belive in focus on main work(continues project delivery) and do other work that much which was needed.



some important terms:(agile languge)

- the user story(In Waterfall, you get a "Requirement." In Agile, you get a User Story. It ensures the developer understands why they are coding a feature, not just what to code.)

- Acceptance Criteria(A User Story is too vague on its own. Every story needs Acceptance Criteria (AC)—a checklist that must be met before the story is considered "Done.")

- Story Points (Estimation)
In Agile, we don't usually estimate in "hours" (because hours are often wrong). We use Story Points based on the Fibonacci Sequence
- A 1 is a tiny task
- An 8 or 13 is a complex feature



- The Tool: Jira
- Jira is the industry-standard software for Agile. Imagine a digital board with columns:
- to do , in progress , in review(waiting for peer review) and done





The Velocity (The Speedometer):
-Velocity is the average amount of work (in Story Points) a Scrum team completes in a single Sprint. 

The Burndown chart(the countdown)
- This is a graph used to track work remaining in a Sprint.
y-axis is story points
x-axis is time(days of the sprint)
the goal: line should "burn down" to zero by the last day


Kanban & WIP Limits (The Traffic Controller):
- 




Lead Time: The total time from when a customer asks for a feature until it is delivered.

Cycle Time: The time from when a developer actually starts coding the feature until it is finished.
